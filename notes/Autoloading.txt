Every time you want to use a new class in your PHP project, 
first you need to include this class 
(using include or require language construct,
thatâ€™s right this are not functions). 
However if you have __autoload function defined, inclusion will handle itself.

include "classes/class.Foo.php";
 
$foo = new Foo;
$foo->start();
$foo->stop();

Basic Autoloading Example

function __autoload($class_name) 
{
    require_once $DOCUMENT_ROOT."classes/class.".$class_name.".php";
}
 
$foo = new Foo;
$foo->start();
$foo->stop();
