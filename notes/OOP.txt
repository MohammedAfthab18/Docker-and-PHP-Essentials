    // using constructor - Magic Methods in PHP and destructor is also a Magic Method in PHP
    public function __construct(float $amount, string $description , float $taxamount , float $discountamount) {
        $this->amount = $amount;   // this.amount = amount
        $this->description = $description; // this.description = description
        $this->taxamount = $taxamount; // this.taxamount = taxamount 
        $this->discountamount = $discountamount; // this.discountamount = discountamount
        echo "Transaction created: {$this->description}<br>";
    } 

    // Destructor
    public function __destruct() {
        echo "Transaction destroyed: {$this->description}<br>";
    }

1. Destructor is a special function that gets called automatically when an object is destroyed or when the script ends. 
2. Destructors are defined using the __destruct() method. This method doesn't take any parameters and is automatically 
   invoked when an object is no longer needed.
3. Until the reference to the particular instance still persits, the destructor won't call in 
4. we can unset()function to call destructor to close the class.
5. Setting the object to null also can call destructor 
6. will be using in long running script and some database scenarios
