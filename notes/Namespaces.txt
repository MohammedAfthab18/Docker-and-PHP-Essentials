Namespaces in PHP serve as a way to encapsulate items such as 
classes, interfaces, functions, and constants.

If class is declared and never used a namespace for that class,
it gets in global space.

for example
    - i have class Transaction in two folders with the same name 
      so like class transaction in payment/user/transaction.php and 
      in payment/gateway/transaction.php.
    
    - so both gets in global scope and makes it difficult for the php to 
      which one to insantiate and gives an fatal error , 
      so namespaces are important concept in OOP 
    
    - same for all classes , abstract classes , interfaces , 
      traits ,functions and constants.

Namespaces are virtual directory structures of your classes

We can declare namespaces using namespace keyword

how to resolve it ?

    use namespaces 
     
    - namespace anyName or directory name (recommended) 
       for eg :- 
       1. namespace  payment\gateway;
       2. namespace  payment\user;

    now use these namespaces in the index.php

    First method 
       
        var_dump(new payment\gateway\Transaction());
    
    Second method 
     
        use payment\gateway\Transaction; --  import it using the use keyword
        var_dump(new Transaction())

    Namespaces name definitions
      qualified namespace - Notifications\email
      fully qualified namespace - \Notifications\email
      unqualified namespace - email
      relative namespace - namespace\Notifications\email
